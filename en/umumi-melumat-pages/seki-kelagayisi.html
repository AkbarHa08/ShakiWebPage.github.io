              Kalagayi is a rectangular headdress made of silk thread for women in Azerbaijan. In the western part of Azerbaijan, kalagai is sometimes called chargat. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Azerbaijan's traditional kalagai centers changed their position for various political and socio-economic reasons, especially as a result of the displacement of cheap factory goods from Russia by artisanal quarry products. In 2014, the future was included in the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO.

              The production of kalagai has long been known in Azerbaijan. Some sources state that the use of women's headscarves, similar to modern kalagays, was widespread among the women of the palace in the V-VI centuries BC during the reign of Shah Dara I of Iran. The 10th century Hudud al-Alam geographical treatise states that the head covering was produced in the city of Barzand.

                In the Middle Ages, there were small enterprises producing kalagai in the territories of Azerbaijan. According to historian Mais Jafarov, kalagai were originally made individually, but later there were special enterprises that produced kalagai. George Forster's report of 1784 states that up to 400 tons of silk were sent from Shirvan to Astrakhan. Literature and field-ethnographic materials prove that a significant part of this silk fell to the share of Basqal, and kalagai took an important place among them. At that time, along with the cities of Ganja, Shusha and Sheki, Basgal was one of the largest silk centers in Azerbaijan. The Basqal kalagai, which has gained special value in world markets since the 18th century, is also included in the travelogues of travelers to the Caucasus.

                In 1862, Azerbaijan participated for the first time in the world exhibition in London, when Nasir Abdulaziz oglu, a weaver from Basqal, was awarded a silver medal and a special diploma for his elegant kalagai and delicate ganouz fabric. When the master of kalagai returned from London, he said: "The British ladies did not manage to get the public to watch a kalagai. In an instant, they bought them all at the fair. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, the traditional centers of culture in Azerbaijan were closed due to various political and socio-economic reasons. In particular, cheap factory goods imported from Russia have shifted their position as a result of the displacement of artisanal quarry products, and greed has gradually begun to concentrate in only two centers - Basgal and Ganja. In Ordubad, kalagai was mainly used in the 19th and mid-20th centuries.

                On the eve of the First World War, there were 900 artisanal wineries in Basqal with 1,500 looms, which produced 1.8 million kalagas a year. Since the Basgal dyes could not afford to paint so much, most of them were sent to Shamakhi, Ganja and Baku. A document on the 1st Congress of Caucasian Artisans, convened in Tbilissi (Georgia) in 1902, contained the following interesting ideas: It amazes people with its art and beauty. There are no machines or other machines used in Europe. The product they make is the result of hard work and skillful hands. "

                “Kalagayi” Silk Center has been operating in Basgal settlement of Ismayilli region since 2003 at the initiative of “Inkishaf” Scientific Organization. There is also a unique interactive museum "Kalagayi" in Basqal. Visitors to the museum can get acquainted with the history and traditions of the future, as well as see the process of creation of art live, and even participate in the development of the product. Fashion designer Fakhriya Khalafova has repeatedly used kalagai in her clothing collection. According to the fashion designer, the future must be modernized for mass use, and new samples must be released for production. Psychologist Rena Ibrahimbayova, in her speech at TEDx Baku in 2011, claimed that kalagai depicts human life: "There is a certain system of kalagai patterns, and everyone who makes them must follow that system. The patterns on the skull depict the structure of the universe and the world. The border at the edge of the baby means a mountain, it protects people. The border in the middle depicts the other world, and as can be seen from the patterns, that world is more colorful and complex than it is today. Rena Ibarhimbayova noted that the development of silkworm breeding in Azerbaijan is directly related to the production of kalakai. The descendants of Shamilov, the descendants of Shamilov, are considered masters of this art. At the meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO on November 26, 2014, the art of the future of Azerbaijan was included in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO under the title "Symbolism and traditional art of the future." In the same year, Azerbaijani Ambassador to Jordan Sabir Aghabeyov presented Azerbaijani flags to representatives of the Jordanian royal family, members of the government, as well as diplomatic colleagues accredited in Jordan at the traditional "Diplomatic Market" in Jordan. In 2016, the European Azerbaijan Society (TEAS) organized the boutique "Kalagayi" by Azerbaijani designer Manzar Hajiyeva at the Beaugrenelle shopping center in Paris.

                    Widespread among the peoples of the Middle East and the Caucasus, kalagais vary in size and color. Older women usually wear dark, wide skirts, while young women wear small white and colorful skirts. In a horse race organized on Novruz and other folk festivals, the winning horse hits an egg on its forehead and breaks it, and a red kalaga or cloth is tied around its neck. Kalagayi is also used in white khoncha. He puts malt on this khoncha, which is covered with a red kalagai or fringed torch, and colored candles are lit. Older and older women tie the kalakai on a turban or ding, and young women and girls use it as a blanket. Women wear black at mourning ceremonies and colorful veils at weddings. When the bride is brought, cover her head with a white veil, It is one of the national traditions of Azerbaijan to tie onions, oranges and cornflowers to the front of the cart or to the neck of the horse on which it is mounted. There are also customs such as visiting mosques and shrines when the intention is fulfilled, and giving a share to the poor and disabled. Kalagayi was once considered the foundation of a newly formed family in Azerbaijan. Thus, the girl who gave her future to the boy swore that she would remain faithful to her love for life. Or at the embassy, ​​one of the women on the boy's side would present an engagement ring wrapped in a red cloak to the girl's house. It was also considered the most valuable gift in the khoncha of women who came to the wedding.

                    Buta-shaped patterns were painted on the kalagai in the Middle Ages. This also played the role of the manufacturer's seal. These seals were stamped on the forearm by the manufacturer after the right arm was painted naturally in the form of a fist, and from the imprint of the fist it was known to which master the forearm belonged. The shape of the buta, which is punched on the forehead, has been formed and improved over time and has become a tradition. The patterns on the kalagai were divided into the following main groups: images drawn along the edges of the kalagai and forming a border; corners and exposed images. The bow (border) and sometimes the khoncha (middle) of the kalagai were decorated with geometric and floral patterns. The kalagays of this or that wine-making center were distinguished by their ornaments on the wind. "Shah buta", "Saya buta", "Khirda buta" flavors were mostly used among Sheki and Basgal kalagai. "Heyrati", "Onani", "Istiotu", "Albukhari", "Abi", "Yeleni" colorful kalagays have gained great fame in Azerbaijan. The ornamental wooden molds used to decorate the bas-reliefs were mainly made of walnut and oak. The names of Basgalli Haji Hamid Talib oglu, Karbalai Abdulkhalig Ashraf oglu, as well as weaver Alabbas Jabrayil oglu are among the decorators who lived and created in the XIX century. At the same time, it was technically impossible to paint the future. The embroidery, as a rule, began with the sailing part of the kalagai. The basic patterns were swayed in the same way, and the middle part was usually counted. The printers tried their best to save on materials. To do this, the first "so-called" kalagai was taken from its natural color. The master performed the operation by dipping the mold in oil and pressing it carefully along the edge of the mold, without breaking the symmetry. This required a masterful eye, high skill, and sharpness. After performing the first fabrication, that part of the kalagai was assembled by hand, and the rest, that is, the uncoated part, was wrapped in a reed. In the next operation, the sage of the kalagai was painted in the intended color. After dyeing, the product was squeezed, hung, dried, re-spread on the paint table and flowers were taken from the color. At the end of the pressing process, the kalagai were filled into pots filled with soap and boiled water, washed until the fat was removed, and dried by hanging from the ropes. After ironing the dried scarves in four bundles, they were placed between two planks on a machine called a "clamp" and fastened with screws on the sides. After being squeezed between wooden clamps for 2-3 hours, the kalagays were opened and hung on a rope. After the moisture was removed, they were collected from the exhibition and folded, and again they were collected in batches and handed over to the tongs for the second time. The supported kalagai remained in this position for a day and "took the layer". Different color ores are used in the production of kalagai,
