              Sheki is one of the oldest cities in Azerbaijan. It has been a republican city since January 4, 1963. In medieval sources, his name is Shaki, Sheka, Shakki, etc. called as. The city of Sheki has long been called Nukha. The powers of the head of the Sheki city executive power also apply to the Sheki region. Sheki is located in the north-west of the country, on the southern slope of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, on the left bank of the Kish River, at an altitude of 632 m above sea level, 370 km from the capital Baku, far from the central regions - in an isolated area. There are 71 settlements in the district. 1 of them is a city, 2 are settlements, 68 are villages. As a result of charming nature, unique historical and architectural monuments, developed craftsmanship, protection of rich historical and cultural heritage, Sheki has become an important tourist region of Azerbaijan. If we approach the city from the north on the steep roads of the Khan plateau, we will come across two large abysses, the Jackal and the Ottal, formed by two ravines. Sheki has a strange structure. The Gurjanchay River, which flows from east to west, divides the city into two parts, the higher part is the southern part and the other part is the northern part of the valley. Sheki is one of the oldest cities in Azerbaijan. In medieval sources, his name is Shaki, Sheka, Shakki and so on. called as. In the middle of the 18th century, after the city of Nukha, near Sheki, became the center of the Sheki khanate, the old city of Sheki disappeared from the scene of history. One of the ancient authors, Ptolemy, noted that there was a settlement called "Niga" among the Albanian cities. According to Abbasgulu Bakikhanov, the city of Nukha is the city of Nakhia and Najia, which in ancient times was considered one of the cities of Shirvan. AY Krimsky shares Niga's opinion that Nukha is the next. However, at the beginning of the 19th century, there were opponents of this view. Academician W. Dorn believed that Niga was located in the area between Iberia and Alazan and could not be equated with Nukha. The connection of the word "Nukha" with the ancient Niga settlement is still controversial. It is believed that the name "Sheki" is associated with the name of the Sak tribes, who moved to the South Caucasus and from there to Asia Minor through the Derbent Pass on the northern shores of the Black Sea in the VII century BC. They captured the best lands in the South Caucasus and named them Sakasena.
