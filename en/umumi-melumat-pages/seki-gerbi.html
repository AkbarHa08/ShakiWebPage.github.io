              The coat of arms depicts an octagonal grid element reminiscent of the moon and stars in the middle against the background of the Sheki fortress. A white horse is shown in front of the network. "Shaki" is written in white on the silk fabric below the coat of arms. The tower and silk fabric are decorated with different shades of blue, and the network is decorated with blue, red and green colors, as in the Azerbaijani flag. The castle usually covers the main official in the coat of arms, as it is defensive in nature. The moon and an eight-pointed star are engraved on the Azerbaijani flag, which is reflected in the network element. The network element is shown as a symbol of Sheki, the land of artists. The white, royal horse figure is a symbol of talent, as well as a coin of the 18th century Sheki khanate. The head of the horse shows a special metal object attached to the horse's head in ancient Azerbaijan. Sheki, which is considered to be the land of ancient silk-making, has a silk cloth painted on the coat of arms and the word "Sheki" is reflected on it. The national "buta" element can also be found here. Thus, the coat of arms shows elements such as a fortress built of river stones typical of Sheki, a castle gate belonging to the Muslim East, a network of our folk art reminiscent of the moon and stars, a horse symbolizing victory, and silkworm breeding. These colors and elements reveal the past, present and main character of the city of Shek, which is more than three thousand years old. The author of this coat of arms is a resident of Sheki, "Graphics" of the Tashkent Art Institute. Tahir Ahmadiyya oglu Hamidli, a member of the Azerbaijan Art Union, is a graduate of the faculty. The coat of arms was approved by Sheki artist, architect and city administration in 2001.
