                Mirza Fatali Akhundov was born in 1812 in the city of Nukha. His father Mirza Mohammadtaghi and mother Nana khanum moved to Khamna settlement near Tabriz in 1814. He lived with his family in different regions of South Azerbaijan until he was 13 years old. In 1825 he returned to Sheki with his mother. Akhund Haji Alasgar, Fatali's mother's uncle, who wanted him to become a clergyman, took him to Ganja in 1832. Young Fatali studied logic and jurisprudence, as well as calligraphy from the great Azerbaijani poet and philosopher Mirza Shafi Vazeh. However, Mirza Shafi's influence on young Fatali did not end there. This meeting has a serious impact on the life and work of Mirza Fatali, in general, on his formation as a thinker. Interested in the modern sciences of his time, Fatali entered the Russian school opened in Sheki in 1833 and studied there for a year. In 1834 he went to Tbilissi (Tbilisi), was appointed a translator of Oriental languages ​​in the field of civil affairs at the headquarters of the Caucasian deputy, and worked in this position until the end of his life. In 1873 he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In 1851, Akhundov was elected a member of the Caucasus branch of the Russian Geographical Society and was later involved in research work at the Caucasus Archaeological Commission. He attached great importance to the publication of the "Akinchi" newspaper, published articles in its pages with the signature "Lawyer Nation-Unknown". Mirza Fatali Akhundov's daughter Nisa khanum was the wife of Khanbaba khan. Mirza Fatali Akhundov died in Tbilissi (Tbilisi) in 1878 and was buried in the old Muslim cemetery (the pantheon of prominent Azerbaijanis located in the territory of the present-day Tbilisi Botanical Garden). Mirza Fatali Akhundzadeh, as a realist artist, the founder of our dramaturgy, a poet and a prose writer, has an exceptional contribution to the development of our literature. The 40-year-old creativity, socio-political and educational activities of the prominent writer are rich and multifaceted. Born in Sheki, Mirza Fatali's father is Mirza Mohammadtaghi, a small trader, and his mother is Nana. Mirza Mohammadtaghi, from the Khamna settlement of South Azerbaijan, returned to Khamene with his wife Nana and two-year-old Fatali due to trade difficulties. Here, Nana, who was in constant conflict with her husband's first wife, divorced her husband four years later and came to live with his uncle Akhund Alasgar, who lived in the Garajadag district of South Azerbaijan with Fatali. The author writes in his autobiography: "From this date, I left my father and never saw him again. A year later, Akhund Haji Alasgar began my training and education.… This Akhund Alasgar was a great man. However, he had perfect knowledge. He adopted me. I became known among the people as the son of Haji Alasgar. " A year later, Akhund Haji Alasgar began my training and education.… This Akhund Alasgar was a great person. He had perfect knowledge of all Islamic sciences, whether Persian or Arabic. He adopted me. I became known among the people as the son of Haji Alasgar. " A year later, Akhund Haji Alasgar began my training and education.… This Akhund Alasgar was a great person. He had perfect knowledge of all Islamic sciences, whether Persian or Arabic. He adopted me. I became known among the people as the son of Haji Alasgar. "

               Haji Alasgar, who was visiting Mecca, took him to Ganja to study the laws of logic and sharia, and entrusted him to an akh named Molla Hussein. Mirza Fatali, who also studied here with Mirza Shafi Vazeh, under the influence of his teacher, decided to become a clergyman and decided to enter the civil service. When his uncle returned from the trip, he found out about his intentions and brought him to Tbilissi (Tbilisi) and appointed him as a translator's student in the office of Baron Rose, the chief judge of the Caucasus. Here he also mastered the Russian language, and was transferred to the position of translator, showing skill and effort in his work. Mirza Fatali, who successfully worked in this position for 44 years until the end of his life, was awarded orders and medals of Russia, as well as orders of Turkey and Iran. MFAkhundzadeh taught at the Tbilisi emergency school for several years. then he was fired at his own request and replaced by his teacher M.Sh. He gave it to Vazeh. For some time he also worked as a teacher of the Azerbaijani language at the Tbilisi Theological Seminary. Mirza Fatali, who left for Iran with a delegation in connection with the civil service, got acquainted with the life of the people during a visit to some cities of South Azerbaijan, and collected material for his future works. At that time, Tbilisi, the administrative and cultural center of the Caucasus, played a major role in MFAkhundzade's literary destiny. Here, communication with such prominent writers as A. Bakikhanov, I. Gutgashinli, M. Sh. had a positive effect. He was a regular reader in this environment, He studied classical Eastern literature, Russian and European literature. Performances of European and Russian playwrights in the Russian Drama Theater aroused great interest in MFAkhundzadeh's dramaturgy and theater. The writer, who deeply studied the subtleties of the art of drama, laid the foundation of dramaturgy in our literature by writing six comedies in 1850–1855. These comedies were published in the Russian translation of the author in the newspaper "Kafkaz". MFAkhundov's comedy "Monsieur Jordan and the dervish Mastali Shah", known as a playwright, was staged in 1851 at the House Theater in St. Petersburg, and the comedies "Khirs Guldurbasan" and "Vazir-khani Lankaran" were staged at the Russian Theater in Tbilissi (Tbilisi). MF Akhundov married Nana khanum, the daughter of Akhund Haji Alasgar, and the death of his children from this marriage in infancy caused deep sorrow in the family. Of his children, only his son Rashid bey and daughter Nisa khanum were able to live for a long time. After the death of Akhund Haji Alasgar, the financial situation of Mirza Fatali, who took care of his family, worsened because he had no other source of income than his civil service salary. Using his authority under the Caucasian deputy, MFAkhundzadeh managed to release G. Zakir and his children, who had been exiled by the tsarist judges, from captivity and exile. He also defended the inheritance rights of Mehdigulu Khan's wife and daughter Natava, the last ruler of Karabakh. Also, after the death of the ruler of Ganja khanate Javad khan Ziyadkhan oglu in the battle with the tsar's troops, he managed to return part of his property to his heirs. One of MFAkhundzadeh's greatest dreams was to change the Arabic alphabet. Unable to realize this dream, the writer wrote: "Unfortunately, neither in Iran nor in the Ottoman Empire did the leaders of the Islamic peoples take the initiative to change the Islamic alphabet for the sake of the people's progress. May all the current sciences of Europe be translated into the language of the Islamic peoples within a few years, and may the Islamic peoples be on the path to happiness with the spread of the sciences. " MF Akhundzadeh, who devoted his whole life to the progress of his people, died in 1878 after a serious illness. He was buried near Vazeh's grave.

              <p>
                By creating his six famous comedies in 1850–1855, MFAkhundzadeh laid the foundation of drama not only in Azerbaijani literature, but in the Turkic-Muslim world from the Balkans to India as a whole. With these comedies, the great master set an example of writing drama in the Eastern world. Everyone agrees that dramaturgy in the Turkic-Muslim world developed in the light of the traditions of Mirza Fatali Akhundzadeh's dramaturgy. The Azerbaijani theater was founded on the basis of Akhundzadeh's immortal comedies. In 1873, Hasanbey Zardabi together with Najaf bey Vazirov laid the foundation of the theatrical movement in Azerbaijan and in the Turkish-Muslim world in general by performing the famous play "Haji Gara" in one of the Baku schools. For the first time in Mirza Fatali Akhundov's comedies, scenes of Eastern women were created on the example of Azerbaijani women. In the 19th century, it took courage to show an Azerbaijani woman laughing and talking with men on stage. Azerbaijani enlighteners were able to carry out this great work by staging the works of Mirza Fatali Akhundzadeh. MF Akhundov's work quickly attracted the attention of European literary critics and theater critics. In August 1852, the German magazine Magazine für die Literatur des Auslandes (Journal of Foreign Literature) wrote: It turned out to be Tatar Moliere, whose name deserves attention beyond the borders of his country. He is Mirza Fatali Akhundov. " In 1837, at the age of 25, M.F. He saved Russian poets, who were forced to remain silent because of the tsar's hand in the tragic death of Alexander Pushkin, and fulfilled the civic duty of Russian writers. In 2012, a biographical feature film about Mirza Fatali Akhundov was shot at the Jafar Jabbarli Azerbaijanfilm film studio. The film "Ambassador of the Dawn" was released on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the thinker.     </p>
