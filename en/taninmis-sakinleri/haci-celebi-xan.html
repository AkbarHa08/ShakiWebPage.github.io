               Haji Chalabi khan was a distant successor of Dervish Muhammad khan, who led the revolt of the Sheki against Safavid Shah Tahmasib I in 1551. Haji Chalabi khan was the first to leave Nadir Shah's subordination and declared the independence of Sheki while he was still alive. It all started with Nadir Shah's strict tax policy against Shirvan and Dagestan. The wave of protests reached as far as Sheki. Appointed by Nadir Shah Afshar to rule this province, Malik Najaf turned the population against him with heavy taxes and extreme oppression. The people of Sheki complain about his oppression to Nadir Shah, who was in Derbent at the time. Nadir Shah, seeing the growing dissatisfaction with his policy in Azerbaijan and Dagestan, wants to solve the problem. He instructs the nobles of Sheki that Let them choose an official who can control the activities of Malik Najaf and send him to the Shah. At the end of 1741, the Sheki chose Haji Chalabi, a wealthy and influential figure, as their representative. The Shah appointed him a lawyer for the Sheki district and gave him the authority to oversee the taxes collected by Malik Najaf. After that, Haji Chalabi actually took power. He does not hesitate to openly interfere in many of the affairs of Malik Najaf. Najaf came to Nadir Shah's camp to complain about Haji Chalabi: "Chalabi does not allow me to carry out the Shah's instructions. He does not listen to me and disturbs the people." Not wanting to miss such a rich district, Nadir Shah invited Haji Chalabi to his camp and wanted to hang him. However, Haji acted boldly and managed to convince Nadir Shah that this accusation was not true. He says, "Malik adds a number of other tasks to whatever he receives from the shah." Nadir Shah believed, forgave Haji Chalabi and gave him greater powers. He said angrily to his emirs: "At a time when all of you could not raise your voice knowing this, Chalabi was not afraid of me and expressed his opinion. Now you will see, he will do something again. I am never wrong in my opinion." He forgives Haji Chalabi and gives him greater powers. He said angrily to his emirs: "At a time when all of you could not raise your voice knowing this, Chalabi was not afraid of me and expressed his opinion. Now you will see, he will do something again. I am never wrong in my opinion." He forgives Haji Chalabi and gives him greater powers. He said angrily to his emirs: "At a time when all of you could not raise your voice knowing this, Chalabi was not afraid of me and expressed his opinion. Now you will see, he will do something again. I am never wrong in my opinion."

               After Nadir Shah left Shirvan in 1743, protests against him began again. Taking advantage of this, Haji Chalabi, together with his loyal men, attacked Nadir Shah's successor, Malik Najaf, and killed him. After that, he declared Sheki an independent khanate. Fuad Aliyev writes: "Thus begins the process of formation of small state institutions - independent khanates in the territory of Azerbaijan. It is noteworthy that if most of the independent khanates were formed after the fall of Nadir Shah, the Sheki khanate still considers its independence raised in the years. " In the winter of 1744, Nadir Shah sent his army against the rebel Haji Chalabi. Haji Chalabi, seeing this in advance, withdrew his photos and called on them to hide in the famous fortified and equipped fortress called Gelersen-Gorersen Fortress after Nadir Shah's attack. Nadir Shah marches on the fortress with a select army of 15,000. But in less than three days, he had to retreat without even building a siege. The Shaki people, with their sudden exits from the fortress, inflicted heavy blows on Nadir Shah's army. In one of these attacks, Nadir Shah himself would almost die. Pictures get a great booty. Nadir Shah draws his army to Barda. After fortifying there, he set out for Derbent at the end of 1744 with an army of 30,000. In February, he came upon Haji Chalabi again. The siege of the fortress will not yield any results again. Enraged, Nadir Shah burned ancient Sheki and the surrounding villages to ashes. For almost three years, the heroic figures suffered severe deprivations in the Galasan-Gorasan fortress and resisted Nadir Shah's superior army in every way. Finally, in March 1746, Haji Chalabi signed a contract with Nadir. Nadir Shah appointed a relative of Najaf as the king of Sheki, but at the same time gave the king's authority to Haji Chalabi and sent him a large tribute. This already meant the victory of Haji Chalabi. Because a year later, when Tbilisi, Ganja, Nakhchivan and Yerevan turned their backs on Nadir Shah, Haji Chalabi was ready to start new protests against Nadir Shah.

                Haji Chalabi's fame, as well as the mobilization and armament of his troops, are growing so much that people from all over the Caucasus are appealing for help. Thus, one of the sources shows that in the summer of 1748, after the people of Ganja, who were worried about the redheads, appealed to Haji Chalabi, he went there with Ali khan and stayed there. "After being awarded the rank of Panahali bey khan and starting construction work in Bayat fortress in 1748, his hostile neighbors turned to Haji Chalabi for help. They appeal to Chalabi. " However, Panah Ali khan was warned in advance and was able to organize a reliable defense of the fortress. Therefore, Haji Chalabi's troops had to retreat. When he returned, he said, "Until now, Panah khan was unpainted silver. We went and struck this silver and returned." After that, Haji Chalabi often took care of increasing the military and economic power of his khanate at the expense of his neighbors.

               After the siege of Shusha, but not successful, Muhammad Hasan khan Gajar withdrew from Karabakh. Panah khan Garabagli, Karim khan Garadagli, Heydargulu khan Nakhchivanli and Shahverdi khan Ganjali came together to discuss Haji Chalabi's actions. It is said in the meeting that Haji Chalabi does not count them and "does not come to peace and friendship" with them. They decide to start a fight with Haji Chalabi and convey their decision to the Georgian tsar. The tsar invites them to talk. These four khans, who came to negotiations, were captured in 1752 near Ganja by the Georgian tsar Teymuraz and his son Irakli with the intention to capture Ganja and Karabakh. One of the servants of Shahverdi khan Gajar (according to another version, Panah khan's son Ibrahim Khalil khan) had an opportunity to send a message to Haji Chalabi about the incident. Haji, with a magnificent army, confronted the allied troops and decided on the other side of the Kura. Haji Chalabi wants to save the captured khans. But he knows that his commanders will speak. Therefore, before opening the meeting, Haji Chalabi said the following words, which later became a rumor: "Whatever decision you make, the conversation about crossing the Kura must be there." The Malikis did not want to start the meeting and said: "We came to the meeting only so that the work would not reach the level of the Kura. But if you want, let it be so. Command the army to attack." Haji Chalabi orders the troops to cross the Kura. "Near the holy tomb of Sheikh Nizami, where the divine light illuminates the hearts and minds of the people, the two armies come face to face and the battle begins." Georgian troops are suffering a heavy defeat. Irakli II escapes and saves his life. Chalabi khan drove the Georgians straight to Tbilissi (Tbilisi) and appointed his son Agakishi bey as the ruler of all liberated territories - Ganja, Gazakh and Borchali. This was Haji Chalabi's second clash with the Georgians. At first, the combined Georgian-Kakhet troops led by Irakli II and Teymuraz III wanted to teach Sheki khan, who had gathered a lot of strength in a short time. Initially, the photos were taken in front of the Georgian army. But this was nothing but a military ploy. Taking advantage of the Georgians' loss of vigilance, Chalabi Khan soon attacked them himself and fled, losing the enemy's manpower and considerable military load. In 1755, Haji Chalabi marched on Shirvan with a large army and besieged Agsu. Huseynali khan from Guba came to the aid of Shirvan people. Chalabi khan was defeated and retreated. Haji Chalabi died in 1755. The transformation of the Sheki khanate into the most magnificent and developed Azerbaijani khanate is one of its exceptional services. Chalabi has done a lot to improve his capital, Sheki. Madrassas, mosques, caravanserais, baths and schools are being built here. Since then, Sheki has amazed people with its unique beauty.
