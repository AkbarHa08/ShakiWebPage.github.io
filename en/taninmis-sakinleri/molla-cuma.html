              Molla Juma (full name: Suleyman Salah oglu Orujov; d. 1854, Ashagi Layisgi, Nukha district, Yelizavetpol province, Russian Empire - May 1920, Ashagi Layisgi, Sheki region, Azerbaijan SSR, USSR) - Azerbaijani ashug and poet. The most reliable sources about the life of Mullah Juma are poems and epics. The date of Mullah Juma's birth has been estimated so far. He was born in 1854 in Ashagi Layisgi village of Nukha district. He was given the nickname "Mullah" because he was literate. Mullah Juma's main occupation was farming. He reaped in the fields of the rich of Gakh, Zagatala, and Balakan, and supported his family with the wages he earned. Mullah Juma received his primary education in Ibrahim Efendizadeh's madrasah in Ashagi Goynuk village. In a short time he learned Arabic and Persian perfectly. But he quickly left the madrasa; Poetry and words attracted more and more young people with beautiful poetry. He was an active supporter of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918-1920. At that time, in Karabakh and Zangazur, Armenian bandits were attacking the civilian Azerbaijani population, and in Sheki, as in other regions, volunteer groups were formed to help the Azerbaijani army. One of these groups was created by Ashug Mullah Juma and his cousins. In May 1920, after the Sovietization of Azerbaijan, all his relatives were arrested in the repression carried out by the Bolsheviks. This injustice affected him and shook him. Oral information about the death of Mullah Juma can be divided into three groups. According to the first option, During the arrival of the 11th Red Army in Azerbaijan, the mullahs were gathered, taken somewhere and secretly killed. The second option is that Mullah Juma was among the villagers during the shooting and, like many others, was shot. The latest version, and the one claimed by many, is that the ashug was killed by a sword by Armenian soldiers dressed as soldiers when the 11th Red Army arrived.
