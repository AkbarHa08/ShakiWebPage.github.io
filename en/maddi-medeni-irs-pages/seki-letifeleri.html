              Anecdote - a small event with a humorous content or a sentence that expresses a complete idea. The anecdotes, also called ornaments, ridicule the ugliness of the time and the mischief in public life. Laughter in anecdotes takes the form of both subtle humor and bitter sarcasm and sarcasm. The history of Azerbaijani anecdotes is connected with the name of a historical-mythical person named Molla Nasreddin. He attracts attention with his quick wit. You, the Mullah, who is joking and sometimes ignorant, exposes many ugliness and evil deeds in the society. Some of the Azerbaijani anecdotes are related to Bahlul Danand, Haji Dayi, Abdal Gasim, Ayrim Tagi and others. Compared to other genres of the epic type, anecdotes are shorter in volume and are usually told in the form of prose. The essence of the anecdote becomes clear at the end. Sometimes these endings are used as a parable among the people. For example, "The mistake is in the oil jug", "I don't know forty at once", "Grandparents came out", "The fight was a quilt fight", "You don't count the rider", "I will plant wool" and so on.

              It is said that the author of many Sheki anecdotes was Haji Feyzi oglu Ilyas, who was born in Sheki in 1900 and was known for his wit. However, experts attribute the reason why the name Haji became a symbol of Sheki to the fact that most pilgrims in Azerbaijan live in this city.

              It is very difficult to say to which pilgrim the Shaki anecdotes were addressed. Mirza Abduljabbar, Mashag Isfandiyar, Gabirgazan Gulu, Khoruz oglu, Farrukh, Gabardin oglu, Eshalan Nuru, Yesil uncle, Dekan Tofig, Baba oglu Ahmad, who are distinguished among the people for their humor, are among the creators of such anecdotes.
              
              Agali Mustafayev, the author of the Sheki dictionary, says that anecdotes still exist today.
              
              In addition to being concise, the anecdotes should also convey salt to the people. Of course, the Sheki dialect plays a big role here.            </p>
