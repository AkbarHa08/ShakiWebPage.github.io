              Architectural monuments include Sheki Khan's Palace, Shakikhanov's House, Gilakli Mosque Minaret, Mosque, Fortress Walls, Sheki Round Temple (XVII-XIX), Zayzid Temple (XI-XII), Kish Albanian Temple of the nearby Kish village, Sheki Caravanserai. In order to distinguish the specific features of the planning of the ancient city, it is important to study the general construction of city streets and the architecture of Sheki. Unlike other medieval cities in Azerbaijan, which have gradually built streets, this work in Sheki was carried out in a short time and in a planned manner. The main and longest street of Sheki, parallel to Gurjanchay, contains the most important architectural monuments of the city. Many streets of Sheki attract attention with the presence of historical and architectural monuments. In the first place, of course, is Sheki Street, which is the main street. Examples of these streets are Heydar Aliyev, Mohammad Amin Rasulzadeh, Khoyski, Afghans, Arkhustu, Ganjali, Baghbanlar, Sherbabalar, Mirza Fatali Akhundzadeh, Mehdi Huseyn.

                The Gurjanachay and Deyirman-arkhi rivers were used not only to meet the city's water needs, but also for irrigation. Later, a new center with a square was built at the confluence of the rivers. The most important reason for the construction of Sheki in this area is the Gurcanachay factor. The other river, the Deyirman-Arkhi River, serves as the second leading means of the city. The natural beauty of Sheki is reflected in all the historical monuments built in the city. All these are features of Sheki architecture. There are almost no examples of architecture reminiscent of the ancient city. Only in the memoirs of E. Chalabi there is some information about Sheki. According to him, the Sheki fortress was built on a hill. The fortress has two gates called Shirvan and Ganja. Thousands of houses, seven mosques, Among them, Mirza Ali Mosque attracts special attention due to its location on Bazar Street. The city also has several caravanserais, hotels, baths and a small market. According to this information, there were enterprises engaged in the production of silk and large gardens engaged in the production of unparalleled silk outside the walls of the unbounded Sheki fortress. According to the city's Chalabi, there were about 20,000 people in 3,000 houses.

               The main streets are divided into slightly narrower streets, bends and alleys, depending on local conditions. The plan provides easy access to the main, leading streets in the direction of the river, which in turn is one of the factors necessary for the economic activity of the population. The artisans' district also gradually approached the streets where the main trade took place. It should be noted that the medieval city of Sheki was large enough for its area. One of the main factors playing a role in the planning of Sheki is the natural factor. An example of this is the water supply of Shaki. As we already know, water operates through underground clay pipes, as well as through a flow-based system. This, in turn, is a clear example of the unity of Sheki with nature. Another feature that distinguishes Sheki from other cities is that it is relatively clean. We can find this in the writings of APZiisserman, who described Sheki in his memoirs in the 19th century. According to him, Sheki, which has a beautiful natural landscape, was located at the mouth of a small mountain river and was full of greenery, walnut, hazelnut and mulberry trees. The streets of Sheki are always kept clean, and even special people have been assigned for this purpose. In general, Shaki has an indescribable effect on people with its attractive natural scenery, cleanliness, cool air, and the sounds of nightingales singing in the evenings.
