              The fortress is located in the higher part of the city, in the north-east and surrounds Sheki khan's palace. The fortress is located not only militarily and strategically, but also in a very favorable microclimate. The total length of the castle walls is 1300 m, the wall on the north side is 4 m high, and the wall on the south side is 8 m high. The thickness of the castle walls is 2.2 m. The castle has two gates on the south and north sides and towers for protection. Today, despite the restoration work carried out in 1958-1963, the castle walls and towers are in a state of disrepair. According to the plan mentioned on February 26, 1853, it was planned to restore about 40 historical monuments in the fortress. It is a natural phenomenon that During the restoration of Sheki, which lasted about 50 years since it became part of Russia, many changes were made to the previous plan of the fortress, but in general, the fortress was able to maintain its original appearance. Initially, the changes took into account the requirements of the garrison, but later the living conditions were taken into account. In the end, it can be concluded that despite some changes, Sheki Khan's palace has not undergone significant changes in planning.

                There are also water wells inside the fortress, which can be used as a reserve water supply if the water of the Gurcanachay is cut off during an enemy attack. According to Kullasovsky, Sheki water pipelines attract attention with their simple structure, affordability and low cost. The water system is flow-based and moves through large-diameter earthenware pipes buried in the ground. These pipes are poured into tanks made of red brick. A large water pipe comes to the jaw, and then water is distributed to users through two or three smaller pipes from the tank. Also, all the streets and squares of the city are supplied with water from here. The compatibility of the water supply with such a simple mechanism allows each house to meet the water needs, as well as those who want to build a fountain in front of their house.
