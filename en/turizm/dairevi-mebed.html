                        <p>The main part of the circular temple (without extensions) is completed with a dome, and this initial part differs significantly from other buildings in the castle due to its architectural style and the type of construction materials used in its construction. For this reason, some researchers attribute its history to the period of Caucasian Albania. However, in the middle of the 20th century, when inspecting the Nukha fortress, experts came to the conclusion that all the buildings inside the fortress, which covers an area of ​​6 hectares, belong to the Russian period, except for the mosque and the Sheki khan's palace. The circular temple was the only Orthodox church in the present-day city of Sheki from 1853 to the beginning of the 20th century. The church building was previously built in a circular plan with clean-cut limestone and was completed with a dome. Later, it was expanded on three sides with river stone and brick masonry, and it was shaped like a cross (when viewed from above). This work took place until 1853. Thus, in the 1853 plan of Nukha fortress, the church building is shown together with its cross-shaped appendages. As it is known, the walls of Nukha fortress were built in such a way that when viewed from above, its name is read in the Arabic alphabet as "Muhammad… (khan)". It is said that in this reading, the church building was the point of the letter "Nun" with its initial circular appearance. The initial circular part of the church differs significantly from other buildings in the castle due to its architectural style and the type of construction materials used in its construction. Or did the Russians build it in a circular shape after 1819 and later expand it to a cross in 1853? Or did this building exist in the Nukha Fortress until 1819, when the Russians converted it into an Orthodox church in the form of a cross until 1853? There is no mention of the church in the 1819 description of the Nukha fortress. However, after the description of many buildings in the Nukha fortress and their coordinates, it is also noted that "other buildings in the fortress belonging to the leaders of Sheki were captured by soldiers and Khoylu." From this note it is clear that some of the buildings that existed in the castle at that time may not be shown in the description, and for this reason, It is not possible to determine on the basis of the description whether the church existed in Nukha fortress in 1819. Currently, the former Orthodox temple is registered as the "Round Temple" and has the status of an important architectural monument in the country. Inside the former church building is the Sheki Museum of Applied Arts.  </p>

                        <p>The name of the church is mentioned in a source from 1861 as "Nukha Trinity Church" (Russian: Нухинская трехсвятительская церковь), and in another source from 1905 as "Nukha Holy Church".  </p>

                        <p>A source from 1853 states that Father Yevstafiy was a priest in the church, and a source from 1861 states that a person named Yevstafiy Khuchiyev was a priest. From 1894 to 1896, the name of the psalmist in the church was Gabriel Pechensky. A 1905 source states that David Utiyev (David Utiyev was a priest of the Ingilis Church in 1875 and tried to Christianize the people of Tasmali village) was a priest. David Utiyev's grave is on the south-west side of the church. In the middle of the 20th century, when inspecting the Nukha fortress, experts came to the conclusion that all the buildings inside the 6-hectare fortress, with the exception of the mosque and the Sheki khan's palace, belong to the Russian period, although There have been no mosques in the castle since 1853. Apparently, the Trinity Church was meant when it was not an older mosque. The reason may be that the books of the famous Russian traveler Segal and Rashid bey Efendiyev, one of the prominent enlighteners of his time, published in 1902 and 1925, respectively, claimed that the Russians had built the khan's house Orthodox in 1828. turned into a church. Indeed, a description of the Nukha fortress in 1819 shows that below the house of Mohammad Hasan khan, to the left of the entrance door, was the khan's private temple. But that small church, measuring 2x2 m, was inside the house of Mohammad Hasan Khan, and until the 1990s there was a small church there. The Trinity Church is at least 50 meters south of the church. The graves of several high-ranking Russian Russian officials who died in Nukha during the Russian Empire are now on a plot of land to the east of the church. It is possible that the area was a Russian cemetery, where more Russian officials and Russian servicemen were buried.
